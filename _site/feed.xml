        <title>Solved - Reset Wordpress admin password no email, no phpmyadmin access</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a small wordpress blog running live through Digital Ocean server. I don’t publish new posts quite often and it had been a while since I had logged in to my wordpress admin panel. I tried logging in but I couldn’t. I simply forgot what password I had set, I tried every passwords but didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem here was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I tried &lt;strong&gt;lost password&lt;/strong&gt;? link to reset password but I didn’t receive any reset emails (may be because I had turned off &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mail()&lt;/code&gt; function or for other reasons)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;since I was hosting with digital ocean’s wordpress default image, I didn’t have phpmyadmin and couldn’t change password through phpmyadmin, (there could be other way around accessing database but it tool me some time to find out how to do it and I eventually gave up)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I couldn’t reset password, and following is what I found on the internet and it worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reset-wordpress-password-through-file-manager---functionsphp&quot;&gt;Reset Wordpress password through file manager - functions.php&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this, you need to have access or get connected to your server. You might need to browse through &lt;strong&gt;FTP&lt;/strong&gt;s, &lt;strong&gt;SSH&lt;/strong&gt; or any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a SSH login via terminal to my digital ocean droplet, and navigated to find where  my wordpress’s functions.php file was located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me the location was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@myserver:/var/www/html/wp-content/themes/mytheme# 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, you will find your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;functions.php&lt;/code&gt; file inside &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt; folder in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wp-content&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need editor to add a line to functions.php.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To edit with vim,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;vi functions.php
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;add this line under the line containing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wp_set_password('new-password', 1);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save your file, in vim use keys: i to inset, ctrl+o, :wq to write and quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;new-password&lt;/code&gt;: password you would like to create
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;: user id number, if you are unsure about id number, you can use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wp user list&lt;/code&gt; command or if you have few user accounts you can try my way: I have 3 user accounts and I tried resetting password to each account as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;wp_set_password('new-password', 1);
wp_set_password('new-password', 2);
wp_set_password('new-password', 3);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This actually worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now goto your wordpress login url, when you try logging in, you will find that you won’t be able to login, as this would reset password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, return back to above &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;functions.php&lt;/code&gt; file and remove the lines that you just added and try logging in, and you will get access into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comment down, if you are confused anywhere. :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Withdrawing Google Adsense Payment to eSewa in Nepal via Western Union</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;google-adsense-nepal&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
If you are a Google Adsense publisher based in Nepal, receiving your hardearned Adsense revenue don’t give you several options. Withdrawing your payment is possible either through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Western Union Remittance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wire Bank Transfer
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6 sm-5 xs-5 tableofcontent&quot;&gt;
	&lt;h3 class=&quot;rhre&quot;&gt;This post is about&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;hre&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#google-adsense-nepal&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Google Adsense Payment in Nepal&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;hre&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#adsense-code&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Getting code from Google Adsense&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;hre&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#adsense-esewa-payment&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Withdrawing in Esewa account&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;#adsense-payment-verification&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Verifying payment&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;bank-draft&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For wire bank transfer, you need to have a bank account is USD, which is another hard story to get in Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for most publishers, Western Union has been the preferred payment method in Nepal from Google Adsense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One usual method is to visit nearest Western Union agent near your location with the transaction code to withdraw money. But what if you want to receive it to your account staying in home?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is all about receiving your Google Adsense payment via Western Union in eSewa, one of the popular payment gateway of Nepal. Once you receive payment in eSewa, you can transfer it to bank account or use it for various transactional purposes.
&lt;a name=&quot;adsense-code&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To withdraw adsense payment to your eSewa account:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;login to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/adsense/&quot;&gt;adsense account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;navigate to &lt;strong&gt;Payments&lt;/strong&gt; menu
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/google-adsense1.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Google Adsense Payment Nepal western union esewa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in next page, clicking on &lt;strong&gt;View Transactions&lt;/strong&gt; which takes you to page like below:
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/google-adsense2.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Google Adsense Payment Nepal western union esewa&quot; /&gt;
As in above image, you can see your transaction id in blurred section, you can note down or copy it or click on this link where you can get detailed information. what we need is this code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;adsense-esewa-payment&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;go to your &lt;a href=&quot;http://esewa.com.np&quot;&gt;eSewa account&lt;/a&gt; and navigate to Western Union from menu option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are making use of eSewa’s Western Union Pick up feature here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember, your esewa id name and the payment details name in Google Adsense should match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/google-adsense3.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Google Adsense Payment Nepal western union esewa&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;paste your code and give few details
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;confirm the MCTN number
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/google-adsense4.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Google Adsense Payment Nepal western union esewa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;adsense-payment-verification&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if the transaction was successful, a confirmation message will be displayed on the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/google-adsense5.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Google Adsense Payment Nepal western union esewa&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can also verify by viewing your eSewa statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/google-adsense6.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Google Adsense Payment Nepal western union esewa&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all, by now, your adsense earning must be in your eSewa account, now you can transfer to supported local banks, or spend the way you like!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comment down, if you have any queries. :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Process of Obtaining Bank Draft in Nepal</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is about how you can obtain Bank Draft from major bank in Nepal. I am sharing this information on the basis of how I obtained one from Nepal Bank Limited. This process is almost similar in every banks throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6 sm-5 xs-5 tableofcontent&quot;&gt;
	&lt;h3 class=&quot;rhre&quot;&gt;This post is about&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;hre&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#bank-draft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Bank draft&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;hre&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#why-bank-draft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Why bank draft?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;hre&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#documents-needed-bank-draft&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Documents needed for bank draft&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;hre&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#bank-draft-process&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Bank draft general process&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;hre&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#draft-info&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Wise words&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;#bank-draft-images&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. Useful images and Links&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;bank-draft&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-bank-draft&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Bank Draft?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple words, it is a cheque(AC payee), that you obtain from Nepal’s Bank which you can carry with you to your destination country and withdraw money from Banks their.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Wikipedia defines Bank Draft as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A banker’s draft is a cheque provided to a customer of a bank or acquired from a bank for remittance purposes, that is drawn by the bank, and drawn on another bank or payable through or at a bank. A normal cheque represents an instruction to transfer a sum of money from the drawer’s account to the payee’s account.
&lt;a name=&quot;why-bank-draft&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-you-need-bank-draft&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do you need Bank Draft?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are travelling abroad, you might need some foreign currency for different purposes. You can carry money in the form of cash, bank draft or in debit/ credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;carrying huge cash with you is riskier and might be harder to get lot of cash in Nepal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you didn’t find foreign currencies in cash in Nepal, so you thought of Bank draft&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you need to take some money from Nepal to abroad in legit way&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;obtaining international debit/ cards in Nepal isn’t that tough but has long process
&lt;a name=&quot;documents-needed-bank-draft&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-you-need-to-make-a-bank-draft&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you need to make a bank draft?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make bank drafts for several purposes, and documents required may vary with different destination countries and banks in Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I visited to Nepal Bank Limited, and found this helpful information there, this might be helpful for you too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;-documents-required-for-obtaining-bank-draft-for-australia&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt; Documents Required for Obtaining Bank Draft for Australia:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;photocopy of your passport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;photocopy of your visa&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;photocopy of your ticket

        <title>Queen for Seven Days - Korean Drama Review</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-src=&quot;/assets/Queenforsevendays1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;Queen for Seven Days - Korean Drama Review&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I love Sageuk dramas. K dramas have always been  ‘heart soothing’ medicines for me. I love the plot, performances of actors and everything about it! However, it’s not everyday that you get to watch a ‘One in a million’ kind of drama and I have once again come across one. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most beautiful tale which has so much sad plots, twists &amp;amp; turns and of course this drama will really make you cry all the time for the 20 episodes. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t prefer sad stories however, I tried with this drama for once because of the several wonderful reviews and now, this story has made me write one. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-src=&quot;/assets/Queenforsevendays9.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;Queen for Seven Days - Korean Drama Review&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Queen for Seven days’ is a 20 episodes drama loosely based on Queen Dangyeong who became the scapegoat of the power struggle in the Josoen politics. Queen Dangyeong was deposed and  had her title stripped just after the seventh day of her husband King Jungjong’s reign. This story is also based on the triangle love of the two brothers - King and  the crown prince. Moreover, this drama shows the fate off star crossed lovers, who got married after several obstacles but never got to spend their lifetime together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional story goes like this - The queen got deposed and was sent off to the far away mountain, isolated from her husband. The husband, King Jungjong would always look over the mountain to see how his beloved was doing. The queen would then place the red skirt her husband gifted her to signify that she was alright and she still yearned for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-src=&quot;/assets/Queenforsevendays2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;Queen for Seven Days - Korean Drama Review&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drama had splendid plot. However at times I felt it was too much of a heartache to watch. Actors played really well, I mean, impressively well. The aura, the ambience this drama showcased was superb. Excellent acting, best cinematography, the music, instrumentals everything was perfect. However, I wished so bad to have
a happy ending.I know happy ending was impossible  because this is a historical drama and it would be worse to change the ending ofcourse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drama revolves around three main characters. Shin Chae Kyung, Lee Yok and Lee Yung Park Min Young, who played as Shin Chae Kyung (Queen Dangyeong) belongs to a wealthy, noble family. Her father is a very  loyal servant in the palace and  works for the King. She later gets married to Lee yeok.  Lee Yeok, played by Yeon Woo jin is the young prince, the king’s brother. He and lady Shin fall for each other and are also the star crossed lovers. And, Lee Yung who is the King Yeongsam is played by Lee Donggun.Unpopular with people and extremely
tyrannical king, he also falls for Lady Shin and protects her as much as he can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-src=&quot;/assets/Queenforsevendays8.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;Queen for Seven Days - Korean Drama Review&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee Yung is the son of a former deposed queen and has always been undersetimated by his father. He has lived all his adolescence by hatred from his father and his step mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He loves his younger brother Lee Yeok with all his heart but his jealousy and insecurities regarding the throne compells him to sour his relationship with his beloved brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then fakes his late father’s will and gets to the throne and starts his tyrannical rule on Joseon. He sees his younger brother as a threat however certain political incidents happen that turns out to castrate the younger prince, Lee Yeok from the palace. Lee Yeok seems to have been dead but returns after 5 years to avenge for what happened to him and to get on the throne as a revenge to his elder brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-src=&quot;/assets/Queenforsevendays3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;Queen for Seven Days - Korean Drama Review&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Lady Shin has always missed her childhood buddy, Lee Yeok as both of them were set to marry since childhood ( as the wish of late King). However, due to the series of incidents, Prince Yeok disappears ( faked his own death). But Lady Shin nevers believes him to be dead. Fate brings these two together and they indeed get married but they never get to live together, the saddest part. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lady Shin frequently finds herself between two brothers. The story turns out to be a love triangle between these three. Both prince try their best to secure her. However, she becomes the scapegoat of many political events
and thus leaves palace in the end. In the last segment of the drama, it is shown that they both stay apart for 40 years yearning for each other. The King ( Former Prince Yeok) wears the dress sewn by her queen and looks at the mountain saying ‘I still love you my queen’ and the queen looks up high from the mountain wearing the red hanbok her king gifted her as a sign that she still misses her. Before leaving the palace, there is a scene that literally tears our hearts. :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-src=&quot;/assets/Queenforsevendays5.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;Queen for Seven Days - Korean Drama Review&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;King asks Queen not to leave and stay by his side while he reigns Joseon with justice.Queen in reply says that she has to go so that he does his job without any worries and political rivalries. He could call her ‘home’ and he can return to her (home) after he completes all his job as a king.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two minutes of the drama showcases that Queen Dangyeong returns to the palace after 40 years to stay with the King for the final few years. The king still wears the same dress her wife sewn for him. The queen still wears the same hanbok he gifted her. Then the queen sits with her king and says ‘My King, You are now home’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-src=&quot;/assets/Queenforsevendays6.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;Queen for Seven Days - Korean Drama Review&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 20 episodes were totally awesome. The actors took their portrayal to the whole next level. Park Min Young must have cried gazillionth time in the drama. I know this is a historical drama and there’s no way directors could mould any fiction here. But, I wanted a happy ending for them. Though the drama shows queen returning after 40 years but in real she dies all alone, childless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img data-src=&quot;/assets/Queenforsevendays7.jpg&quot; class=&quot;lazyload&quot; alt=&quot;Queen for Seven Days - Korean Drama Review&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I wanted her to have a happy life with her King whom she waited all years to see his face. I wanted them to have a lovely family of 4. The King dreams about having a family with his queen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a tragic tale of love where two lovers get married amongst the several circumstances but cannot stay together. Constantly fate tears them apart and  political conspiracies break them down time and again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Everything you need to know about obtaining NOC Letter</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Ministry of Education, Scholarship Wing in Kaiser Mahal, Kathmandu issues No Objection Letter popularly known as NOC Certificate for all Nepali applicants who have studied or have taken equivalency degree of Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, when you possess a NOC letter, it means that the Ministry of Education, Nepal Government has no problem with you in studying in foreign nation, or you haven’t received scholarship from Nepal Government or the final reason is you have legal permission to send/pay/get fees in foreign currency to foreign nation for educational purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me make this clear, 
so you have received your offer letter or i20 from your desired foreign instituion and now you need to pay your admission fees from Nepal. You can pay your fees by different ways, one genuine way is to do SWIFT Bank Transfer to your college/university through licensed Banks in Nepal. To send money on your behalf, Banks in Nepal will require you to present NOC issued from Education Ministry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listed below are the major steps involved in obtaining NOC certificate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can download form online from education ministry’s official site at &lt;a href=&quot;https://moe.gov.np/content/no-objection-letter.html&quot;&gt;https://moe.gov.np/content/no-objection-letter.html&lt;/a&gt; or can get one in counter or in the shops outside.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Documents required:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;passport original &amp;amp; copy,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;citizenship original &amp;amp; copy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;offer/ i20 letter from university,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;academic transcript original and copy of last academic degree, if no original all notarized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;submit filled form and docs at counter 3 for ruju/ verification&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;after officer at counter 3 has approved your documents and application go to counter 2 for voucher and payment 2000 each degree&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;once you have made deposit, go to counter no. 4 for submitting documents and take token no. they provide you&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;be back to counter 6 after time they say: 1hr with token no.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the general process, and you will get your NOC letter within same day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Incase, officer asks you to get permission/ letter from Nepal Health Professional Council(NHPC) then, you need to visit to NHPC office at Bansbari, Kathmandu and follow these steps:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Documents required:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;passport( original &amp;amp; copy),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;citizenship(original &amp;amp; copy),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;offer letter,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;and all docs as mentioned in 2&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;hand written application for agreement form that you won’t come back to NHPC seeking for registration/ license&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;filled form&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deposit voucher slip of NPR 1500 in NHPC SBI Bank account&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;directly go to room number 3 and submit there and come to room 1 and wait until they call ur name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Connecting Wifi in Guangzhou Baiyun Intl Airport</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;abc&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4j40o4nxa6w?controls=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1min video on getting connected to wifi in Baiyun Intl Airport. Last time, I was in Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, I found it difficult to know how could I connect my phone to wifi as I couldn’t understand Chinese and was just confused. I found many passengers there having hard time connecting to wifi, it would have been easier if tapping on Free Airport Wifi SSID in phone would connect us to internet in few clicks but the pain here is you need to get your id and password before, but where do you get it from? This video becomes helpful in such situations, you can see self service machines around airport where you can get your wifi id and password upon id verification. Comment down if you have any queries below!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>6 important things International Students must do after arriving in Australia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I will list and explain in brief the first essential tasks that you do or need to do to make your stay pleasant in Australia. There are still lots of things and works to do, I am trying to list some basic works here, that I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6 sm-5 xs-5 tableofcontent&quot;&gt;
	&lt;h3 class=&quot;rhre&quot;&gt;This post is about&lt;/h3&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;hre&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#accommodation-australia&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Accommodation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;hre&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#bank-account&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Opening Bank Account&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;hre&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#sim-card-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Getting SIM Card&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;hre&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#transportation&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Buying a metro card&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class=&quot;hre&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#visit-university&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Visiting University&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;#apply-tfn&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. TFN Application&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;accommodation-australia&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently residing in South Australia, and all steps are somehow similar in all the states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;1-accommodation&quot;&gt;1. Accommodation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you land in Australian Airport, have someone to pick you up, or you can take public transportations to reach to your destination. If you already arranged accommodation, then its easier for you. Else, you can stay for few days in hotels, lodges and hostels. Shared apartments, housings and units are available, you can google for more details. If you have someone here, ask him/ her to guide you or help you in accommodation. You can also find different communities in Social Networks like facebook, who will be happy to help you! They are just a touch way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;bank-account&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;2-opening-up-an-australian-bank-account&quot;&gt;2. Opening up an Australian Bank Account&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The foremost official task to do after being landed in Australia within in few days is opening up a bank account. Bank account is important and needed in most cases here, like paying bills or taking sim cards in plan or be it for debit/ credit cards or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have brought a Bank draft (AC payee cheque) from Nepal, and it was a must for me to get it deposited in bank account as I hadn’t brought any cash with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following are major things to know about opening up a bank account in Australia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;there are different Banks proving banking services in Australia, you can choose your desired one and one which is convenient for you by location, ATMs and more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;visit your nearest preferred branch of bank with &lt;strong&gt;passport&lt;/strong&gt; and you can take your visa paper or remember your visa expiry date incase they ask you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;bank staff will come to you to assist you and open up a bank account for you&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;provide information and answers the staff asks to you and your bank account will be ready in about 5-10 minutes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;they will handover your account details, guide book containing useful information, and a letter that you can provide to your employee to pay you through your bank&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;your cards will arrive in your address you provided in few business days&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if you are depositing bank draft/ cheque, tell bank staff about this and they will be more than happy to assist you and do it for you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the cheque amount will be loaded to your account in few business days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you don’t need to pay any fees or deposit any amount for opening a bank account! 
The regular fee will be waived for few months!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;sim-card-mobile&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;3-buy-a-sim-card-mobile-phone-plan&quot;&gt;3. Buy a SIM Card/ Mobile Phone Plan&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have SIM card, you need to get one here. As you move around town and city you might require data connection to browse internet, to find places and for navigation and routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already have a phone that supports Australian sim card, you can just buy a sim card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to get a mobile phone and sim card, then you can get both in monthly plan, payable in 1/2/3 years depending upon the contract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also buy mobile phones separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few usful things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;take your passport/ student card(if you have or COE incase they ask) and your bank account number and BSB code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;visit your nearest preferred network provider’s store, you might get sim cards in convenience store, mobile phone stores and repairing centers too&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one staff will come to you and assist you in choosing plans. s/he will explain you all details, and would be more than happy to answer your queries&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;choose your preferred data plan and they will activate the sim card instantly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;in most cases, local calls and sms inside Australia are free, you just pay for data plan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you need to sign up a contract paper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you don’t need to pay any fees, in store if your are getting in plan, instead they will be deducted from your bank account in next billing period(unless you are buying a phone paying full price)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;transportation&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;4-buying-a-metro-card&quot;&gt;4. Buying a metro card&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To travel in train, tram or bus you can buy ticket in stations/ stops or in the vehicle itself with cash and card or you can get prepaid cards. Better and easier are prepaid cards, which you can buy from your nearest convenience store. Such card might differ with state. Here in Adelaide, there is metrocard which is valid for travelling in bus, trams and trains. You can load certain balance from the convenience store itself or through different mediums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;visit-university&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;5-visit-your-university-college-and-inform-you-have-arrived&quot;&gt;5. Visit your University/ College and inform you have arrived&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visit your educational institution and inform them you have arrived here in Australia. They might provide you with your student ID card too. ID card is essential if you wish to get concession in public vehicles. Also, inform them about your address you are staying here.
&lt;a name=&quot;apply-tfn&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;6-appying-for-a-tfn-tax-file-number-number&quot;&gt;6. Appying for a TFN (Tax File Number) number&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, but not the least, you should apply for a Tax File Number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you can apply for TFN online through Australia government’s official site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;be aware while googling for site; there might be different ads, australian government sites end with &lt;strong&gt;.gov.au&lt;/strong&gt; domain.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;visit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Tax-file-number/Apply-for-a-TFN/&quot;&gt;https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Tax-file-number/Apply-for-a-TFN/&lt;/a&gt; to appy for TFN&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you need your passport number and address of resident in Australia&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TFN will be posted to your address within 28 days&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you don’t need to pay any charges to apply for TFN!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were the essential tasks to do that any international students or any one coming to Australia needs to do. There might be several others too, if I find any I will update here. If you have any comment down below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Have a good day!&lt;/p&gt;
