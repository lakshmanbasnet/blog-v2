Lately, I got chance to go to religious Bajrabarahi temple. Took a micro from 100m ahead of Satdobato and reached there in 30 minutes. The micro was congested. Thought if we had taken the micro from Lagankhel Buspark it would be easier as bus ply from there.
Gate was open, no tickets needed. Could hear many sounds of picnic teams coming. They were  dancing in different numbers and enjoying. We found 4-5 picnic teams enjoying at their fullest. Also one Newar communitiy were busy having their 'bhoj'.
The area looked dirty. Plastics were all around. The picnic spot was covered by trees and and all greenary could be seen, but also due to negligence the garbages their were really distracting.

Found the temple didn't have 'Gajur', pinnacle. It was interesting. Even though their were well managed rest rooms, the steepy hill, with deep bushes and trees was well defaceted, and stinky.
