For wire bank transfer, you need to have a bank account is USD, which is another hard story to get in Nepal.

So, for most publishers, Western Union has been the preferred payment method in Nepal from Google Adsense.

One usual method is to visit nearest Western Union agent near your location with the transaction code to withdraw money. But what if you want to receive it to your account staying in home?

This post is all about receiving your Google Adsense payment via Western Union in eSewa, one of the popular payment gateway of Nepal. Once you receive payment in eSewa, you can transfer it to bank account or use it for various transactional purposes.
