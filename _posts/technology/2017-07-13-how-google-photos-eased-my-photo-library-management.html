It has been few months that I started using google photos for storing photos. There are lot of reasons why I consider best like it's free, unlimited storage, helps freeing our local storage and more.


Some of the key features of Google Photos are;
It detects:
-People
-Places
-Things
-Videos
-makes smart collages
-creates awesome animations
-generates automatic movies

But Google photos solved one of my problem! Yes, you read it right! 

Once I accidentally erased my local drive partition, there were about 30,000  photos. 

I was successful in recovering my data safely but the problem was: entire recovered files were grouped in random directories and their filename started with something like f11.... .

Can you imagine how difficult would it be to find a particular photo? 

When I searched .jpg then thousands of photos would appear in search result.



Thus problem got solved when I backed up my entire recovered local drive with automatic background process of Google Photos.

And now, guess what? Google photos automatically sorts my photos according to  recognized face of people in the photo.

<br>
And believe me, I have found this face recognition of Google Photos to be 99% accurate. Now, I can get all my photos easily tapping over my face from People section. 

Moreover, Google photos automatically detects things, places, scenarios and groups accordingly.

Thanks to Machine Learning and smart Google!:D
