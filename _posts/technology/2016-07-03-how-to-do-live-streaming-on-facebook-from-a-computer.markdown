In this post I will explain you how easily you can broadcast your live videos to facebook using facebook live.

You can either watch video below or follow the instructions below. I recommend you to watch video.

<div class="abc">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S5L68Ot4ZgA?showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>	
</div>

 * download broadcasting software , I use <a href="2016-07-04-how -to-do-live-streaming-on-facebook-from-a-computer.markdown" target="blank"> Open Broad Caster Software</a> since its free and open source and available for all platforms.
 * login to your facebook, and move to your facebook page's admin panel
 * on the top bar click on publishing tools
 * click on video library in left bar
 * tap on live button in top right
 * copy the server URL and stream key and paste into OBS's setting in stream section
 * make sure your video resolution is set to 1280x720 as facebook recommends this resolution for live videos
 * add your video and audio sources(webcam, microphone, screencapture etc ) in OBS
 * click on start streamin
 * go back to facebook in your browser and click on Preview
 * wait for some time, after you see the video add titles and tags
 * when you are ready GO LIVE !!!
 * After your are done, click on END LIVE
 * Facebook will save your live video, and it appears as a post in newsfeed too.

That's it, this is how you can stream live to facebook page, groups and personal timeline from your laptop or desktop.
