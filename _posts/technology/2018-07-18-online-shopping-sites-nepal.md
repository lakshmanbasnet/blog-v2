<h2 class="rhre">Common Mode of Payment in Nepali ecommerce sites</h2>
Some online shopping sites, accept instant online payment options like paypal, credit and debit cards, while local payment gateways like eSewa and Khalti are also of great choice among several other service providers. Out of all, Cash on Delivery(COD) is the most used payment option in context of Nepal.
