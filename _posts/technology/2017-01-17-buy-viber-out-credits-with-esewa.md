This is a very good news for you, if you were having trouble loading credits in your `Viber`. With Viber Out Credits you can make cheap calls to the numbers across the globe even when they don't have internet connection or viber. 

In Nepal, there is a big hurdle for international payment as Nepali Debit/Cards aren't easily accepted, and there is a big headache if you need to pay foreign companies or clients.

F1Soft International, a Nepal's reputed IT company has launched the service of buying Viber Out Credits with their payment gateway 'eSewa', which is a pioneer payment gateway of Nepal. With this service it has been made a lot easier to purchase viber credits. Few months back, eSewa added the feature to transfer amount from Skrill to eSewa, which is great in itself.

Few hours ago, I tried purchasing Viber Out Credits through eSewa and yeah its more than awesome. To buy Viber Out Credit through eSewa follow these steps:

* goto [https://esewa.com.np](esewa.com.np) and login to your account or sign up

* find `Instant Messaging` Menu in the left vertical bar and click on it

* choose `Viber Out Credit` and click

* enter a desired viber number and choose availble amount from dropdown

* submit the request

* cofirm your details and submit

* you are done now, the transacation details will be displayed

* you can check your Viber account for the Viber Out Credits!

Enjoy making cheap Calls!
