<b>Demat</b> is short form for <b>Dematerilization</b>.


Dematerialisation is the process of converting physical financial instruments such as share certificates, mutual fund investments, and bonds into electronic form.

 An Investor or person having shares of various companies listed by Nepal Stock Exchange(NEPSE) need to dematerialize their physical shares by opening a Demat account.

Recently in Nepal the policy has been enacted that all the shares should be dematerialzed meaning all the shareholders should have Demat account and their share records would be maintained at their respective account number mentioned in the share's applicahtion form.

Some of the major aims of opening a demat account :
<ul>
