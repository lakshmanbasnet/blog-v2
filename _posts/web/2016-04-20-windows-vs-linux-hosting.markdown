So, this is a great point where everyone gets confused. You have decided to get a hosting but you can't decide which hosting to choose.

The simple answer is :

Linux servers are popular and much loved comparatively.

But there is a point where you should use Windows hosting:
if you use this tools/technology in your website  : <b> ASP, ASP.NET, MS SQL.</b>

But you don't care about these than go for Linux hosting. I personally prefer Linux hosting. Its upto you which one to choose.
