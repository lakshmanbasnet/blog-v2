## Why did I need to screencast from iPhone to Ipad? ##
While recording videos or taking photos with the iPhone, I wanted to use my iPad's screen as a monitor. This would save me time in composing the frame and while shooting myself on video, I can use the iPhone's main camera and position myself looking at the iPad.
<a name="solution"></a>
I browsed the internet and there were different solutions but some required jailbroken iPhone or multiple apps to install or were paid apps.   <br><br>


## Solution? ##
I found a video on YouTube that somewhat met my requirement. It was all about Apowermirror app. I tried installing it and checked once, and yeah, it does my job! Possibly it might do yours too!<a name="combinations"></a>  <br><br>



## Possible Screencasting combination ##
You can screen mirror between any two ios devices like:
- iPhone to iPhone screen mirroring
- iPhone to iPad screen mirroring
- iPad to iPhone screencasting
- iPhone to iPod screen mirroring
- or any alternative combinations you can make :)  <a name="screencast"></a><br><br>





## Using Apowermirror for screen mirroring/ casting from iPhone to iPad ##

- Download the [Apowermirror](https://apple.co/2uIje6A) application from the app store on your both ios devices (iPad and iPhone, or iPhone and iPhone) <a href="https://apple.co/2uIje6A" target="blank"> <i>Download Apowermirror</i></a>


- connect both devices to same wifi network! 
This is crucial as screencasting is carried out via wifi signal.

- open Apowermirror app on both devices

- on the device, you want to screencast from, tap screencast icon from the bottom centre

- the app shows your available devices for screencasting quickly as both the devices are connected on the same network or you can use QR code to scan and connect

- tap on the device you want to screencast to

- pull up/ down your control centre and press on screen record option and choose broadcast to Apowermirror

- Voila! In few seconds your iPhone's screen pops up in another device!

- You might want to try rotating orientation to match your need!  <a name="limitations"></a><br><br>

Or watch the [short video](https://youtu.be/LdCy6hQ6kZs) above!


## Limitations of Apowermirror Screencast ##

- must be on the same wifi network, doesn't pair through BlueTooth/ airplay
- few seconds delay in transmission might be noticed but this won't hamper the overall experience
- quality of the screencast transmitted video  <br><br>




Apart from the above limitations, this single app does the job for me! It is free, easy to use, no ads, no sign-ups required or anything!
