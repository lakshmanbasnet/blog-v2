<h2>What is Hunting Reserve? </h2>
According to [glosbe.com](https://glosbe.com/en/en/hunting%20reserve), Hunting reserve is an area of land where the pursuit and killing or capture of game and wild animals is permitted. (Source: CED)


<a name="history"></a>
<h2>History of Dhorpatan HR</h2>

Spreading over the area of 1325 square kilometre in Rapti Zone's Rukum district in Mid Western Development Region and Baglung and Myagdi of Dhawalagiri Zone in Western Development Region of Nepal, locating at the high Himalayas topography and in Dhawalagiri mountain range, it is the only hunting reserve of Nepal. Even though it was established in 2039 Chaitra BS, it was enlisted in government royal paper and declared only in 2044 Baisakh 14 BS. Having Himalayan and high himalayan geographical conditions and habitat it has been contributing in conserving the biological diversity, natural resource conservation along with conservation of important rare wildlife and flora and their management and is strongly involved in developing in the tourism. Also, well managed hunting facilities are being provided of some animals like Naur, Jharal etc.

For the purpose of making hunting well managed this reserve has been divided into seven blocks and professional hunters assist foreign persons in hunting.

    Seven blocks in DHR:

1. Falgune
2. Varshe
3. Dhustung
4. Dogadi
5. Seng
6. Sundah, and
7. Surtivang

This hunting reserve spreads over Rukum, Baglung and Myagdi where the most part(60%) lies in Rukum, around 26% in Baglung and rest 14% in Myagdi.

Hunting can be done by taking permission from Nepal Government to the indicated animal, and specified time and location. This kind of law doesn't generate the situation where any species of animal gets extinct or some gets overpopulated or harm to habitat or to near vegetations. Because of well managed hunting procedures, nation has been successful in collecting foreign currencies and tourism has fostered in the locallevel.

<a name="objectives"></a>
<h2>Objectives of Hunting Reserve</h2>
Even though Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve was established with the aim of providing sports hunting facility to Nepal's and foreign hunters, the main objectives are as listed below:

* to represent geo-natural areas, preserve the ecosystem, of Baglung, Myagdi and Rukum districts of Western and Mid Western Development regions

* by conserving the naturally beautiful geo-scenes, scientific, cultural and refreshing places as well as conserving and managing rare plants and animals develop eco-tourism

* to give continuity to the trend of consuming of facilitires by local citizens so that no bad consequence occurs for natural resource and ecosystem

* to increase public participation in conervation of biological diversity and make them independent in the use of forest resources

<a name="geographical"></a>
<h2>Geographical Conditions of Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve</h2>

    Location

Latitude: 82° 50' to 83° 15'

Longitude: 28° 30' to 28° 50'

Height from Sea level: 2000m to 7246m

    Borders

* north: Churen Puthha and Dhawalagiri Mountain's high snow capped ranges
* east: Darekhani, Jhalke, and Lamakyang hills
* west: Khariwang river, Kulta Bhanjyang, and Jagla Bhanjyang
* south: Surtivang and Uttarganga

* Mountain ranges in the north are covered with snow almost all round the year
* hills in the south are covered with snow only in winter
* <div class="cate"> Most of the reserve area is covered by high grasslands, steep hills, rocks, summits and snow while rest with vegetations, Kharka, forests, rivers and some cultivable land is also present here</div>

<a name="land"></a>
<h2>Land Use</h2>
Since it lies in the high himalayan region and cultivable land is so less hence people have been using Dhorpatan area for grazing. During rainy season, they graze cattle and grow potato, maize, buckwheat in sides of Uttarganga river in Nisheldhor area. As most of the area is covered with kharka, forest, snow capped mountain ranges, and rocky hills, agriculturable land is too less here. According to the Geo-Consumption map of 1986's GIS map, Landuse of DHR is as below:

<a name="tourism"></a>
<h2>Tourism Development</h2>
Tourism is considered as the backbone of development. From the date of establishment, Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve has been focussing on natural resource conservation, forest and wildlife conservation, managed hunting facilities to promote eco-tourism. Hunting tourism has fostered and foreign tourists visit this area. Tourists coming from out visit following main places: 

    Major attractions:

* Putha mountain,
* Churen mountain,
* Gurja mountain,
* Sisne mountain,
* Sundah (Reservoir),
* Pupaal Lake,
* Warmi lake,
* Parmi lake,
* Mandre lake,
* Jalpa lake,
* Marchula lake,
* Putha lake,
* Dhor river,
* Sinha Othar,
* Shiva Cave,
* Rudra lake, etc

For visiting Dhorpatan Kartik, Magh, Falgun and Chaitra months are considered appropriate from weather point of view.

Different organizations like 

* Nepal Wildlife Adventur Pvt. Ltd,
* Himalayan Safari,
* Track and Trails Pvt. Ltd,
Nepal Wildlife Safari Pvt. Ltd 

are conducting well managed hunting services for foreigners after participating in government tender process and pay a nice amount of revenue to the government for hunting of wild animals like Naur. These organizations have been conducting hunting service and been doing marketing and advertisement works too. The number of tourists using this reserve's route to reach Dolpa is also high. As, this reserve lies in Dhawaligir mountain range, tourists enjoy the beautiful mountain view of Dhawalagiri from here.


Jaljala, which is in eastern border of DHR is considered as the suitable place for *Camping*. From here, beautiful scenes can be observed. Also, this place is best choice for research of wildlife and vegetations, and observation. If the tourism infrastructures and information communication technologies could be developed well then Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve can serve as the number once choice for adventure hunting of wildanimals like Naur, sightseeing, cultural tourism, research and observation of wildlife and vegetations. Doing this, it would develop this area economically and socially too.

<a name="infrastructures"></a>
<h2>Tourism Infrastructures</h2>
Until the infrastuctures required for tourists like transportation, communication, hotel, lodge, information center, campside etc aren't available then it becomes really difficult for developing tourism. Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve is considered as the best tourist place for natural sightseeing, trek, cultural exchange, observation of wildlife and vegetations and for adventure hunting. But the basic infrastructures required for these haven't been developed well due to which reserve hasn't been able to make remarkable toursit visits.

<figure><img src="/assets/dh/65.jpg"/><figcaption>Community Hotel</figcaption> </figure>


For air transportation, here is one airport. Camping ground has been made in different places. The airport is being reconstructed and hoped to resume the air service. Campsite with kitchen and bathroom has been made in Dhorpatan, Chentung, Gurjakhani, Lamsung and Rukum and Campsites of Chentungm Lamsung and Gurjakhani has been renovated and handed over to local womens to run, whereas the campsites of Dhor and Taksera has been looked by the reserve. Due to the lack of necessay hotels, lodges, and tea shops lack of facilities is seen. Other than this, local hotel, lodge and tea shop operators haven't been able to focus on cleanliness and proper service because of lack of proper training and hospitality knowledge. Upon establishing the proper infrastructures, there is no doubt that the number of tourists flowing here will be drastically increased. In the fiscal yar 068/069, 78 foreign tourists have visited the Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve.

<a name="transportation"></a>
<h2>Transportation</h2>
<figure><img src="/assets/dh/51.jpg"/> </figure>

Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve is considered very backwards in the viewpoint of transportation. Just recently, roads have been made upto the reserve office. The road isn't a metalled one, and isn't gravelled even. Hence, reaching to the office on vehicle is kind of hard journey mostly during rainy season as the muddy road gets weak. By foot, DHR office lies 3-4 days away from all the district headquarters of Baglung, Rukum and Myagdi. After opening of the road, the number of local toursits reaching here have scaled high. Many youths love to come here in bikes. DHR can be reached by charter helicopter services to. Different walking trails have been made by locals to move from one place to other.

    Following means of transportation can be used to reach DHR:


* Kathmandu - Pokhara - Baglung- Galkot-Burtivang-Bobang-DHR Office on vehicle minimum 2days trip
* Chartered helicpoters from any airports of Nepal
* Kathmandu-Tansen Palpa-Tamnghas-Khara-Burtibang-Bobang-DHR Office on vehicle
* Kathmandu-Pokhara-Beni-Durbang-Takum-Lamjung-DHR 


<a name="communication"></a>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<figure><img src="/assets/dh/88.jpg"/><figure>inside Reserve's office</figure> </figure>
DHR lies very far from district headquarters of Baglung, Myagdi and Rukum and hence, in the past it was really difficult for communication. There was no any means of communication except in DHR office which had VHF, Ku Band Communication set. But now, it has been about 3 years that communication services has improved drastically here. Now mobile phones can operate. State owned telecom giant Nepal Telecom has constructed a solar powered station here which relays the satellite signal. Communication can be done through mobile. But sometimes, as weather fluctuates, the station becomes somewhat behind to relay good signal. Also, some villagers have wireless telephone sets. Surfing internet might be impossible here. And also, as you go into more heights away from DHR office are, mobile signal might get lost.
There is facility of electricity, locals have built a small hydropower. Other than that, solar panels can be also noticed well.

<a name="locals"></a>
<h2>Locals and Business</h2> 
<figure><img src="/assets/dh/91.jpg"/> </figure>

    Ethnic groups:

* Magar,
* Biswokarma,
* Chantyal,
* Brahmin,
* Chettri,
* Thakali,
* Nauthar(Nine castes): Adai, Mote Adai, Bhandari, Chota Bhandari, Kathayat, Kather, Kumai Khadka, and Thapa 
* and Tibetians

Even though the villages are small, people rear animals, and do agricluture to make living. Some people do business in <b>Bhot</b> (China border). 


    Major crops grown here:

* Potato, 
* Maize,
* Fapar,
* Buckwheat

Locals keep on migrating to withstand the temperature. During summer, they take their animals to DHR area to graze and live their while in winter as it is extremely cold, they move down to lower warm places with their cattles. People generally travel on horses, keep dog for safety. Also, almost all houses have horses, and the value of horse is so high, people consider having more horses as more wealth. Also, horse racing and more adventure sports are carried out time and again. The DHR has been providing locals with different facilities.

<h2>Tibetan Refugees in Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve</h2>

<figure><img src="/assets/dh/75.jpg"/> </figure>

Since 1959 AD, Tibetan Refugees have been living in DHR . According to the survey by reserve office in 2056 BS the total population of Tibetan refugees here from 46 families' is 234. Also, the US government has been supporting refugees. However, the population now might have changed as they might have moved to other places for business and other purposes.

<a name="hunting"></a>
<h2>Hunting Management</h2>

After receiving the permit paper from National Park and Wildlife Conservation Department, Nepal,  after blocky safety is done, 21 days time is given to foreigner to do hunting of wild animals like Naur, Jharal.  Out of seven blocks, Surtivang and Falgune are in Baglung and Dhustung, Dogadi, Seng and Sundaha blocks in Rukum while Arse lies in Myagdi. Except in Surtivang, in each blocks yearly quota is decided of Naur and hunting is allowed under the assistance of professional hunters. In the fiscal year, 068/069 BS, 25 Naur and 13 Jharal were hunted. According to the surveys conducted in different times, following quota proposal has been made and decided. According to the current declared quota, for hunting of Naur and Jharal 26 and 11 are quotas for hunting.
