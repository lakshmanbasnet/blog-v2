## **What is Bank Draft?** ##
In simple words, it is a cheque(AC payee), that you obtain from Nepal's Bank which you can carry with you to your destination country and withdraw money from Banks their.

<br>
Wikipedia defines Bank Draft as:

A banker's draft is a cheque provided to a customer of a bank or acquired from a bank for remittance purposes, that is drawn by the bank, and drawn on another bank or payable through or at a bank. A normal cheque represents an instruction to transfer a sum of money from the drawer's account to the payee's account.

## **Why do you need Bank Draft?** ##
If you are travelling abroad, you might need some foreign currency for different purposes. You can carry money in the form of cash, bank draft or in debit/ credit cards.

- carrying huge cash with you is riskier and might be harder to get lot of cash in Nepal
- you didn't find foreign currencies in cash in Nepal, so you thought of Bank draft
- you need to take some money from Nepal to abroad in legit way
- obtaining international debit/ cards in Nepal isn't that tough but has long process

## **Bank Draft General Process** ##

After you have general documents required, you need to visit to Bank which provides Bank Draft services. To be sure, you can make call prior visiting. In bank, proceed to respective counter asking at reception and they will hand you with the application form. In application form you mention all necessary details like the amount required in USD or AUD or currency you want, and other vital details like ticket number, passport number.


After you submit your application, one of the officer will check your form and hand you a slip where details like Nepalese Rupees equivalent is mentioned, which you have to pay to Nepali Bank.


You need to make equivalent cash/ cheque deposit in respective Bank's name for the amount you are receiving bank draft. 

After you make deposit to Bank's name, visit back again to Bank Draft section and they will carry the process further ahead.


In about hour or two your bank draft will be ready to collect.

## **What after** ##
after you get your bank draft, keep it safe with you. Make sure it doesn't get damaged. 
Once, you come to your destination country you can withdraw cash from relevant bank or deposit it to your desired bank account. If you happen to withdraw from different bank than the one your draft issuer is tied up with here in destination country, few business days might require for processing. Don't worry about this, your bank will provide you information appropriate to you.
