Ministry of Education, Scholarship Wing in Kaiser Mahal, Kathmandu issues No Objection Letter popularly known as NOC Certificate for all Nepali applicants who have studied or have taken equvalency degree of Nepal. 

Basically, when you possess a NOC letter, it means that the Ministry of Education, Nepal Government has no problem with you in studying in foreign nation, or you haven't received scholarship from Nepal Government or the final reason is you have legal permission to send/pay/get fees in foreign currency to foreign nation for educational purposes.

Let me make this clear, 
so you have received your offer letter or i20 from your desired foreign instituion and now you need to pay your admission fees from Nepal. You can pay your fees by different ways, one genuine way is to do SWIFT Bank Transfer to your college/university through licensed Banks in Nepal. To send money on your behalf, Banks in Nepal will require you to present NOC issued from Education Ministry.



Listed below are the major steps involved in obtaining NOC certificate.


1. You can download form online from education ministry's official site at [https://moe.gov.np/content/no-objection-letter.html](https://moe.gov.np/content/no-objection-letter.html) or can get one in counter or in the shops outside.

2. Documents required: 

- passport original & copy,
- citizenship original & copy 
- offer/ i20 letter from university, 
- academic transcript original and copy of last academic degree, if no original all notarized


3. submit filled form and docs at counter 3 for ruju/ verification

4. after officer at counter 3 has approved your documents and application go to counter 2 for voucher and payment 2000 each degree

5. once you have made deposit, go to counter no. 4 for submitting documents and take token no. they provide you

6. be back to counter 6 after time they say: 1hr with token no.






This is the general process, and you will get your NOC letter within same day.


Incase, officer asks you to get permission/ letter from Nepal Health Professional Council(NHPC) then, you need to visit to NHPC office at Bansbari, Kathmandu and follow these steps:

Documents required:

- passport( original & copy),
- citizenship(original & copy),
- offer letter, 
- and all docs as mentioned in 2

- hand written application for agreement form that you won't come back to NHPC seeking for registration/ license
- filled form
- deposit voucher slip of NPR 1500 in NHPC SBI Bank account
- directly go to room number 3 and submit there and come to room 1 and wait until they call ur name
