I"-<p>Being a big fan of K-dramas, particularly Saguek as they are historical dramas revolving around Joseon eras. I had already watched a handful of best dramas back then and didn’t have many good dramas to watch recently, so I rewatched a very popular drama of 2012 “Moon Embracing The Sun”.</p>
