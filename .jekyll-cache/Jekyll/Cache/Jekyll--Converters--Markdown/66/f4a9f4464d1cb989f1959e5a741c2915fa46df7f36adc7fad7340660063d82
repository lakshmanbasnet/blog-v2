<h2 id="why-did-i-need-to-screencast-from-iphone-to-ipad">Why did I need to screencast from iPhone to Ipad?</h2>
<p>While recording videos or taking photos with the iPhone, I wanted to use my iPad’s screen as a monitor. This would save me time in composing the frame and while shooting myself on video, I can use the iPhone’s main camera and position myself looking at the iPad.
<a name="solution"></a>
I browsed the internet and there were different solutions but some required jailbroken iPhone or multiple apps to install or were paid apps.   <br /><br /></p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution?</h2>
<p>I found a video on YouTube that somewhat met my requirement. It was all about Apowermirror app. I tried installing it and checked once, and yeah, it does my job! Possibly it might do yours too!<a name="combinations"></a>  <br /><br /></p>

<h2 id="possible-screencasting-combination">Possible Screencasting combination</h2>
<p>You can screen mirror between any two ios devices like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>iPhone to iPhone screen mirroring</li>
  <li>iPhone to iPad screen mirroring</li>
  <li>iPad to iPhone screencasting</li>
  <li>iPhone to iPod screen mirroring</li>
  <li>or any alternative combinations you can make :)  <a name="screencast"></a><br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-apowermirror-for-screen-mirroring-casting-from-iphone-to-ipad">Using Apowermirror for screen mirroring/ casting from iPhone to iPad</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Download the <a href="https://apple.co/2uIje6A">Apowermirror</a> application from the app store on your both ios devices (iPad and iPhone, or iPhone and iPhone)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://apple.co/2uIje6A" target="blank"> Download Apowermirror</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>connect both devices to same wifi network! 
This is crucial as screencasting is carried out via wifi signal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>open Apowermirror app on both devices</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>on the device, you want to screencast from, tap screencast icon from the bottom centre</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the app shows your available devices for screencasting quickly as both the devices are connected on the same network or you can use QR code to scan and connect</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>tap on the device you want to screencast to</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pull up/ down your control centre and press on screen record option and choose broadcast to Apowermirror</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Voila! In few seconds your iPhone’s screen pops up in another device!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You might want to try rotating orientation to match your need!  <a name="limitations"></a><br /><br /></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Or watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/LdCy6hQ6kZs">short video</a> above!</p>

<h2 id="limitations-of-apowermirror-screencast">Limitations of Apowermirror Screencast</h2>

<ul>
  <li>must be on the same wifi network, doesn’t pair through BlueTooth/ airplay</li>
  <li>few seconds delay in transmission might be noticed but this won’t hamper the overall experience</li>
  <li>quality of the screencast transmitted video  <br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from the above limitations, this single app does the job for me! It is free, easy to use, no ads, no sign-ups required or anything!</p>
