<p><strong>Why do I need a NOC letter?</strong></p>
<hr />

<p>Basically, when you possess a NOC letter, it means that</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Ministry of Education, Nepal Government has no problem with you in studying in foreign nation, or you havenâ€™t received scholarship from Nepal Government
 or the final reason is</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You have legal permission to send/ pay/ get fees in foreign currency to foreign nation for educational purposes.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><br />
Let me make this clear, 
so you have received your offer letter or i20 from your desired foreign instituion in <a href="/info/first-5-things-to-do-international-students-international-students-australia">Australia </a>Canada, Japan or anywhere and now you need to pay your admission fees from Nepal. 
<br /><br />
You can pay your fees in different ways, one genuine way is to do SWIFT Bank Transfer to your college/university through licensed Banks in Nepal.</p>

<p>To send money on your behalf, Banks in Nepal will require you to present NOC issued from the Education Ministry.<a name="how"></a></p>
