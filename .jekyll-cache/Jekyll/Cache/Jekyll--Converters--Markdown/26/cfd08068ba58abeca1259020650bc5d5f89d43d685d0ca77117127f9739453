<h2 id="bank-draft-general-process"><strong>Bank Draft General Process</strong></h2>

<p>After you have general documents required, you need to visit to Bank which provides Bank Draft services. To be sure, you can make call prior visiting. In bank, proceed to respective counter asking at reception and they will hand you with the application form. In application form you mention all necessary details like the amount required in USD or AUD or currency you want, and other vital details like ticket number, passport number.</p>

<p>After you submit your application, one of the officer will check your form and hand you a slip where details like Nepalese Rupees equivalent is mentioned, which you have to pay to Nepali Bank.</p>

<p>You need to make equivalent cash/ cheque deposit in respective Bankâ€™s name for the amount you are receiving bank draft.</p>

<p>After you make deposit to Bankâ€™s name, visit back again to Bank Draft section and they will carry the process further ahead.</p>

<p>In about hour or two your bank draft will be ready to collect.</p>
