<p>Few months back, I was at Tamrakar complex newroad for repairing my cell phone. And while I was waiting for the servicing to be done. I came to know that these shops charge around 500 Nepali rupees just for creating apple account, which can be created freely. It is okay to charge some nominal fees for making the id but 500 is too high.</p>
