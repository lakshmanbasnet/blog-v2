I"<p>In this post, I will share an idea how you can point your <code class="highlighter-rouge">.np</code> domain website to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Github Pages(gh-pages)</code> website. It is much easier to point any domain towards gh-pages website by simply adding <code class="highlighter-rouge">A Records</code> to domain settings and <code class="highlighter-rouge">CNAME</code> to our <code class="highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> Github repository. But the problem with <code class="highlighter-rouge">.np</code> domains is that we can’t add <code class="highlighter-rouge">A records</code> as their is no any field to add <code class="highlighter-rouge">A record</code> to our domain properties. 
To solve this problem, we will make use of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cloudflare</code> a CDN(Content Delivery Network) that allows us to manage our domains in easiest and reliable way. And also, it doesn’t charge any fees for doing this, and we can manage multiple sites with cloudflare. So follow the steps below:</p>
