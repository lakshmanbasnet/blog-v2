I have a small wordpress blog running live through Digital Ocean server. I donâ€™t publish new posts quite often and it had been a while since I had logged in to my wordpress admin panel. I tried logging in but I couldnâ€™t. I simply forgot what password I had set, I tried every passwords but didnâ€™t work.</p>

<p>My problem here was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I tried <strong>lost password</strong>? link to reset password but I didnâ€™t receive any reset emails (may be because I had turned off <code class="highlighter-rouge">mail()</code> function or for other reasons)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>since I was hosting with digital oceanâ€™s wordpress default image, I didnâ€™t have phpmyadmin and couldnâ€™t change password through phpmyadmin, (there could be other way around accessing database but it tool me some time to find out how to do it and I eventually gave up)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I couldnâ€™t reset password, and following is what I found on the internet and it worked for me.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reset-wordpress-password-through-file-manager---functionsphp">Reset Wordpress password through file manager - functions.php</h2>

<p>For this, you need to have access or get connected to your server. You might need to browse through <strong>FTP</strong>s, <strong>SSH</strong> or any other way.</p>

<p>I did a SSH login via terminal to my digital ocean droplet, and navigated to find where  my wordpressâ€™s functions.php file was located.</p>

<p>For me the location was:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>root@myserver:/var/www/html/wp-content/themes/mytheme# 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Generally, you will find your <code class="highlighter-rouge">functions.php</code> file inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">themes</code> folder in <code class="highlighter-rouge">wp-content</code>.</p>

<p>You will need editor to add a line to functions.php.</p>

<p>To edit with vim,</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>vi functions.php
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>add this line under the line containing <code class="highlighter-rouge"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span></code></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>wp_set_password('new-password', 1);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Save your file, in vim use keys: i to inset, ctrl+o, :wq to write and quit.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">new-password</code>: password you would like to create
<code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>: user id number, if you are unsure about id number, you can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">wp user list</code> command or if you have few user accounts you can try my way: I have 3 user accounts and I tried resetting password to each account as:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>wp_set_password('new-password', 1);
wp_set_password('new-password', 2);
wp_set_password('new-password', 3);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This actually worked for me.</p>

<p>Now goto your wordpress login url, when you try logging in, you will find that you wonâ€™t be able to login, as this would reset password.</p>

<p>Now, return back to above <code class="highlighter-rouge">functions.php</code> file and remove the lines that you just added and try logging in, and you will get access into it.</p>

<p>Comment down, if you are confused anywhere. :)</p>
