I"˚	<p>I am sure you have come across many businesses on Google Maps, where something looks fishy. Even though most of the reviews published on google maps are genuine, there are a lot of fake reviews prevailing for mulitple good or bad reasons.</p>

<p>I have been contributing to Google Maps since long time and I check google reviews for the new places/ businesses that I need to visit or have recently visited. There are several ways you can make a check of the review yourself if they are genuine or not.</p>

<p>First, let‚Äôs start with 
<strong>why fake google reviews?</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Fake positive reviews: Many businesses knowingly write multiple good reviews of their business themselves or ask their staff or pay third parties to write excellent reviews. Major motive behind writing a fake positive review for business: Either to suppress the negative review(s) made by customers or to make an impression on the visitor that the particular business is really good.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fake negative reviews: No business likes to see a negative review in their business listing. Few reasons for fake negative reviews on google maps:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>when a customer isn‚Äôt happy with the product/ service s/he receives from the business, s/he may write a publish a negative review for that business through a fake account hiding his/her‚Äôs original identity. Even though the review may be genuine in such cases.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dirty competition in the business market: Some businesses are too bad to be good. If company A and B are in same business sector, one company may knowingly write/ pay others to write fake negative reviews for the competitor in the market. Here, I don‚Äôt need to tell you, why this is done‚Ä¶.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>‚Ä¶ there can be several other reasons for posting fake reviews like personal grudges, work factors ect.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, we know why people write such reviews, let‚Äôs dig into the main part of our study:</p>

<p>##How to know if a google review is fake?##</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business name is repeated multiple times
One of the most common thing found across fake reviews is the reviewer keeps on repeating company‚Äôs name time and again.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I recently visited <strong><em>XYZ Company</em></strong> to get abcd service. Staffs at <strong><em>XYZ</em></strong> were friendly and helpful in assisting me‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I definitely recommend <strong><em>XYZ</em></strong> for your ‚Ä¶. needs.‚Äù</p>
