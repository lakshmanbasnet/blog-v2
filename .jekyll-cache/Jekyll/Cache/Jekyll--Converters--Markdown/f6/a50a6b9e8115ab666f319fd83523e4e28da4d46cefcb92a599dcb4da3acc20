<p>Sometimes, when you try to download some content from google drive by the link you got shared by some other person, it might say  <i>‚ÄúQuota exceeded. Sorry, you can‚Äôt view or download this file at this time.Too many users have viewed or downloaded this file recently. Please try accessing the file again later. ‚Ä¶‚Äù </i> .</p>

<p>This usually occurs when many users are accessing the same file at the same time, and google has made some limitations to the maximum number of downloads that can be made in unit time.</p>

<p>So, if you need to download any items in such case then what you can do is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>on the top bar, you can get option to add it to your drive</p>
  </li>
  <li>upon adding it to your drive, copy the file</li>
  <li>rename the new copied file (no need to rename the file actually) ;)</li>
  <li>
    <p>you can download now</p>
  </li>
  <li>if it is still not being downloaded then you can manually copy the link and paste it to your download manager.</li>
</ul>

<p>It works. :)</p>
