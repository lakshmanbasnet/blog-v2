I"<p>So, this is a great point where everyone gets confused. You have decided to get a hosting but you canâ€™t decide which hosting to choose.</p>

<p>The simple answer is :</p>

<p>Linux servers are popular and much loved comparatively.</p>

<p>But there is a point where you should use Windows hosting:
if you use this tools/technology in your website  : <b> ASP, ASP.NET, MS SQL.</b></p>

<p>But you donâ€™t care about these than go for Linux hosting. I personally prefer Linux hosting. Its upto you which one to choose.</p>
