I"©<p>Few hours before writing this article, I was trying to setup DISQUS Comment System in this Jekyll site. I went through Disqusâ€™ official siteâ€™s documentation and did exactly same what was told there but for some reasons the comment system didnâ€™t load at all. I looked over the internet, but still no luck .. and later, I started playing around and the comment section just loaded! :D Here is how I did it!
