<p><strong>Quick Facts about NOC Letter</strong></p>
<hr />

<ul>
  <li>issued by the Ministry of Education, Nepal Government</li>
  <li>required by banks to pay application/ tuition fees to foreign educational institutions</li>
  <li>written consent from Nepal Government that MOE has no objection to NOC holder in studying in foreign nations</li>
  <li>can be obtained on the same day of application <a name="why"></a> 
<br /> <br /></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why do I need a NOC letter?</strong></p>
<hr />

<p>Basically, when you possess a NOC letter, it means that</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Ministry of Education, Nepal Government has no problem with you in studying in foreign nation, or you haven’t received scholarship from Nepal Government
 or the final reason is</li>
  <li>You have legal permission to send/ pay/ get fees in foreign currency to foreign nation for educational purposes.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let me make this clear, 
so you have received your offer letter or i20 from your desired foreign instituion and now you need to pay your admission fees from Nepal. You can pay your fees in different ways, one genuine way is to do SWIFT Bank Transfer to your college/university through licensed Banks in Nepal. To send money on your behalf, Banks in Nepal will require you to present NOC issued from the Education Ministry.<a name="how"></a></p>
