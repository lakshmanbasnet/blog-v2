I"U<p>Different ICT  colleges in Nepal are mapped below in the google maps. I had made this custom map couple of years ago but havenâ€™t shared much. So, in this post, I am trying to locate different colleges based on the course they are offering.</p>

<p>Just select the layers for the colleges with courses.</p>

<p>Colleges are grouped by following courses:</p>

<ol>
  <li>B.E Computer</li>
  <li>Bachelor of Information Technology</li>
  <li>BE IT</li>
  <li>BCIS</li>
  <li>Software Engineering</li>
  <li>Foreign University affiliated Colleges</li>
  <li>BCA</li>
  <li>B.Ed ICT</li>
  <li>Bsc CSIT (draft)</li>
  <li>BIM (draft)</li>
</ol>
