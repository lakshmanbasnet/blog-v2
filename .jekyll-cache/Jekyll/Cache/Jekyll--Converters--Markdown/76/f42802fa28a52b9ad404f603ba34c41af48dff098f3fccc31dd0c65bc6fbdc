I"g<p>Recently I got chance to visit Himalayan Height Resort, Hattiban Resort located in Pharping, Kathmandu. It is an hour’s drive from ringroad. Located in top hill, between the woods, the resort is worth to be. Away from the chaotic valley, nature’s silence and well architechtured infrastructures never fail to amaze every individual reaching there.</p>
