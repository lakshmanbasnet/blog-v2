<p>This is a brief guide to Proposal Writing for your Project. Somewhere in your study, or in life, you might have to write proposals before doing your projects.</p>

<p>Generally Proposals are to be submitted to higher authorities or your university/company to inform them what you are doing and how will you do using what type of resources in what time.</p>

<p><i><small>Proposals are written when people need to ask permission to make a purchase, do a project, or write a paper; the proposal is a formal way of putting forth an idea and asking for action to be taken on that idea.</small></i>
<a href="http://examples.yourdictionary.com/what-is-example-informal-written-proposal.html">source</a></p>

<p>Here below, I have described the most precised and general way of writing project proposal.</p>

<p>This guide is prepared in reference to the proposal for Bsc CSIT of TU, however it is almost similar in every field.</p>

<hr />

<p>All the topics are explained in brief below:</p>

<p>Before starting to the main contents, lets know about the general format, fonts and more.</p>

<ul>
  <li>proposal should be short enough to explain your project</li>
  <li>donâ€™t use page breaks to start a new topic, continue writing next topic after a topic finishes with some gap</li>
</ul>

<h3>Page setup</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>line spacing</strong>: 1.5</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Margins</strong>( in inch):Left 1.5, Right 1,Top 1 and Bottom 1</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Font</h3>

<p>any font of Sans Series only(Times new roman, Calibri etc.)</p>

<h3>Font Size</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Title</strong>: 14</li>
  <li><strong>Sub heading</strong>: 12 bold</li>
  <li><strong>Normal texts</strong>: 12</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Latex</strong>: APA format
<br /></p>
<hr />

<p>Lets dive into contents now.</p>

<h2 id="title">Title</h2>

<ul>
  <li>should be catchy and specific to domain not broad</li>
  <li>try to make your title not so long, minimize use of many words</li>
  <li>give your application/product a good name</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<ul>
  <li>introduction is short and right to the point of information</li>
  <li>write what exactly your project does</li>
  <li>in about 2-3 lines</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>This mobile application provides user to track, record, monetize his/her family membersâ€™ travel activities through the use of GPS technology and location services.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="2-problem-definition">2. Problem Definition</h2>

<ul>
  <li>make it critical</li>
  <li>the problem should be stated in such a way that if there is no project there would be a great loss/impact</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<p>These days, parents are having a diffcult time as many children go to different places and donâ€™t tell parents their exact location.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="3-objective">3. Objective</h2>

<ul>
  <li>mention the main aim of your project, think about the outcome</li>
  <li>always start from <strong>To</strong></li>
  <li>objectives should be: specific, measurable , achievable, realistic, timebound</li>
  <li>keep 3-4 objectives</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To develop a mobile application that tracks userâ€™s daily activities</li>
  <li>To make it easier for parents to know where there children are in real time</li>
</ul>

<p>â€¦</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="4-scope-and-limitation">4. Scope and limitation</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In scope write about what consequences your project outcome can bring</li>
  <li>mention what extra feature you would like to add, or write about the scalabity and extendability of your product</li>
  <li>
    <p>you can write about what impacts it can create when it goes on large scale
<br />
Whereas in limitation</p>
  </li>
  <li>write about some of the things you couldnâ€™t include but always wanted to</li>
  <li>mention the performance limitations, real time working dependance</li>
  <li>writing about the accuracy of the data you take and processed result will make your proposal more precised</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="5-methodology">5. Methodology</h2>

<p>While talking about the software development model in our case, in methodoly you write about the methods you are going to use to achieve your objectives.</p>

<p>Its main content should be:</p>

<p><br /></p>

  <li>the reason for choosing this model despite of other models.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h2> 5.2 Study of existing system </h2>
<p>(literature review)</p>

<p>Literature review is the study and research of similar systems/applications that are already developed or are alreay in market which are in someway similar to yours.</p>

<p>Discuss about any such application, their outcome or quote any sayings here. Including date, author name, developer name might be good and attractive.</p>

<p>You can also include at least 5 websites, apps , books etc that are someway related to your project or give you inspiration to do.</p>

<p><br /></p>
