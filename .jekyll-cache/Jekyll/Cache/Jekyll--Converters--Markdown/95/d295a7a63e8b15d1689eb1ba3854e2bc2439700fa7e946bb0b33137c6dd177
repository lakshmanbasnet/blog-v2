<p>While recording videos or taking photos with the iPhone, I wanted to use my iPad’s screen as a monitor. This would save me time in composing the frame and while shooting myself on video, I can use the iPhone’s main camera and position myself looking at the iPad.</p>

<p>I browsed the internet and there were different solutions but some required jailbroken iPhone or multiple apps to install or were paid apps.</p>

<h2 id="solution">Solution?</h2>
<p>I found a video on YouTube that somewhat met my requirement. It was all about Apowermirror app. I tried installing it and checked once, and yeah, it does my job! Possibly it might do yours too!</p>

<h2 id="limitations-of-apowermirror-screencast">Limitations of Apowermirror Screencast</h2>

<ul>
  <li>must be on the same wifi network, doesn’t pair through BlueTooth/ airplay</li>
  <li>few seconds delay in transmission might be noticed but this won’t hamper the overall experience</li>
  <li>quality of the screencast transmitted video</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from the above limitations, this single app does the job for me! It is free, easy to use, no ads, no sign-ups required or anything!</p>
