I"H<p>##Why did I need to screencast from iPhone to Ipad?##
While recording videos or taking photos with the iPhone, I wanted to use my iPad’s screen as a monitor. This would save me time in composing the frame and while shooting myself on video, I can use the iPhone’s main camera and position myself looking at the iPad.</p>
