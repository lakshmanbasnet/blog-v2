<p>Apple has just released the latest version of iOS 10 on September 7. But you might be wondering why it is not available to download from your software update? It will take some time till apple makes it publicly available for downloading. Either you have to wait or if you want to taste the biggest software update till date then there follow this way. You can get this new software update through developer account without paying anything. I just updated my iphoneâ€™s software to iOS 10, and I am loving it. If you too want to update then here is how you can do it.</p>
