I"	<p>My story is :</p>

<p>I updated a website’s content through a windows computer with Kaspersky antivirus enabled on it, I didn’t care much. I accessed that site’s cpanel and was updating through the file manager. And later, my website was unexpectedly slower, yeah slower than slowest. At the bottom of browser it showed <code class="highlighter-rouge">connecting to gc.kis.v2.scr.kaspersky-labs.com</code> and it would take more than a minute to load page.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/kaspersky.png" alt="connecting to gc.kis.v2.scr.kaspersky-labs.com solved" /> <br /></p>

<p>I googled about connecting to gc.kis.v2.scr.kaspersky-labs.com and found out that it was because of Kaspersky Antivirus Internet Protection enabled that was making it slow.</p>

<p>Kaspersky did a Javascript injection on my homepage, possibly! not sure though!</p>

<p>And when I viewed loaded website’s source through view source option than I found that the page was calling to this file(<code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://gc.kis.v2.scr.kaspersky-labs.com/.../main.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>)</p>

<p>This website wasn’t slow on that Kaspersky enabled windows computer only but in every computer’s browser accessed. Even in my linux computer, it said connecting to gc.kis.v2.scr.kaspersky-labs.com when no Kaspersky was in my machine. This made me to dig the story.</p>

<p>If this problem is only on particular Kaspersky enabled windows computer that you can easily solve this by disabling following option from Kaspersky’s setting:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Settings -&gt; Additional -&gt; Network -&gt; Inject scripts into web traffic to interact with web pages.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Else, if your problem is like mine than,</p>

<p>go to your website’s cpanel or source code from where you update your site. Look for code something like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://gc.kis.v2.scr.kaspersky-labs.com/.../main.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>then just remove this from your file, now believe me, your website will be faster. Yeah faster!</p>
