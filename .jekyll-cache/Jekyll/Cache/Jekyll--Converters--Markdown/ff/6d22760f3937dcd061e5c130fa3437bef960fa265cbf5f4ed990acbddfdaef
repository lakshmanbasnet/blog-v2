I"<p>It has been couple of months I have dived into discovering Redhat Enterprise Linux 7.</p>

<p>Meanwhile using this enterpise edition Linux OS, I am making some notes of different things I faced and how I solved so that it would be quicker to solve if I face similar problems in future.</p>

<p>Also, I am making this publicly available so that anyone get the hints when needed.</p>

<p>All the notes are available as short and useful blog posts at

<strong>You might ask why at another sub domain?</strong></p>

<p>I have placed rhel blogs at another sub domain just to make it particularly focused on Redhat things. While this blog is where most others posts will be. I donâ€™t want to make this blog site heavily concentrated with Redhat posts only as I keep writing on diversed topics and my visitors come here for different contents.</p>

<strong>Any other sub domains?</strong> :D</p>

<p>Hmm, not now, but I might add one soon about Onion Omega 2 how to and tutorials.</p>

<p>It might go live on omega.lakshmanbasnet.com, But I am quite unsure till now, to make a separate site or just a thread here with all posts inside.</p>

Why do you keep adding sub domains and make separate website for each? <strong>Why do you spend so much time creating websites?</strong></p>

<p>:D Actually, its just a single command to generate a new blog site for me.
Since, I heavily use Jekyll with Github for blog sites, one can setup a fully functioning, clean and responsive site in just a single command and in few seconds!!</p>
