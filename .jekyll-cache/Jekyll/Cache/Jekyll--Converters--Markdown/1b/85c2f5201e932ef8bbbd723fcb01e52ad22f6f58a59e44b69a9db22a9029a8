<h2 class="rhre">About FBHNEPAL 2018</h2>
<p>RUSLAN Food &amp; Beverage Hospitality Exhibition 2018 is focused exclusively on food, beverage &amp; hospitality, the first and only of its kind in Nepal in recognition of the tremendous growth in the sector. While food and beverage have become big revenue source and profit centres for the hotels, restaurants and ‚Äúparty-palaces‚Äù have mushroomed beyond anyone‚Äôs expectations in the last ten years. Likewise, takeaway food outlets, street food vendors, supermarkets and grocery stores have popped up in every neighborhood and markets in large numbers.</p>

<p>The RUSLAN Food &amp; Beverage Hospitality Exhibition in Nepal hosts about 128 exhibitors, 3  thematic pavilions (Party Venues Pavilion, Hospitality Education Pavilion, Organic Farm Mart) and features 7 interactive live events. And of course, numerous sample tasting counters during the Exhibition to involve and engage the industry professionals, to highlight the exhibition theme as well as enliven the atmosphere for the visitors.</p>

<p>The RUSLAN Food &amp; Beverage Hospitality attracts more than 60,000  business visitors and consumers. While the event is primarily a business-to-business event, consumers are expected to visit in great numbers. Business visitors will be able to check the exhibitors‚Äô list and directly pre-book appointments with the exhibitors for the duration of the exhibition.</p>
