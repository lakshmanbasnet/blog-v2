<p> Few years back, <br />
I was with my mother in a steep hill collecting fodder for our animals. Got a call from cousin bro, saying that he had planned to go to Dhorpatan the next day, and was asking if I would also join. Without much thinking, I immediately agreed to go with him. Because I had heard much about the place, read in books, but had never been there even when it lies in my own district Baglung.</p>

<p>The very next day, I packed my bag with 1 pair of clothes and some basics, waited for bro in Hatiya and from there took a jeep. It took around four hours in four wheeler jeep to reach to Burtibang. As the road isnâ€™t pitched, the journey of rough roads is interesting and a headache too.</p>
