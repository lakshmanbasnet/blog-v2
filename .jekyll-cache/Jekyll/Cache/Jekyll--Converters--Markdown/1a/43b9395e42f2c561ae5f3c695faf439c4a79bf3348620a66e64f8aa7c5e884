Even though most of the reviews published on google maps are genuine, there are a lot of fake reviews prevailing for some good or bad reasons. Considering the below mentioned ways you can spot fake reviews in any platforms other than Google Maps too. <br /></p>

<p>There are several ways you can make a quick check of the review yourself if they are genuine or not.
<br /><br />
First, let’s start with</p>
<h2 id="why-fake-google-reviews">Why fake google reviews?</h2>

<h3 id="1-fake-positive-reviews">1. Fake positive reviews</h3>
<p>Many businesses knowingly write multiple good reviews of their business themselves or ask their staff or pay third parties to write excellent reviews. <br /></p>

<p>Major motive behind writing a fake positive review for a business:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Either to suppress the negative review(s) made by customers or</li>
  <li>To make an impression on the visitor that the particular business is really good.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="2-fake-negative-reviews">2. Fake negative reviews</h3>

<p>No business enjoys reading a negative review in their business listing. 
Few reasons for fake negative reviews on google maps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>when a customer isn’t happy with the product/ service s/he receives from the business, s/he may write a publish a negative review for that business through a fake account hiding his/her’s original identity. Even though the review may be genuine in such cases.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dirty competition in the business market</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some businesses are too bad to be good. If company A and B are in same business sector, one company may knowingly write/ pay others to write fake negative reviews for the competitor’s google maps listing. Here, I don’t need to tell you, why this is done….</p>

<ul>
  <li>… there can be several other reasons for posting fake reviews like personal grudges, work factors ect.
<br /><br /></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, we know why people write such reviews, let’s dig into the main part of our study:</p>

<h2 id="how-to-know-if-a-google-review-is-fake">How to know if a google review is fake?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Business name is repeated multiple times</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the most common thing found across fake reviews is the reviewer keeps on repeating company’s name time and again.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I recently visited <strong><em>XYZ Company</em></strong> to get abcd service. Staffs at <strong><em>XYZ</em></strong> were friendly and helpful in assisting me…… I definitely recommend <strong><em>XYZ</em></strong> for your …. needs.” 
<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Profile photo
<img src="/assets/google-reviews.jpg" alt="find fake google reviews" /></li>
</ul>

<p>It is optional to upload your real photo in Google profile. But the fake reviewer will hardly upload his/ her own photo, or use someone else’s photo or leave it default. 
<br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Too less reviews/ contributions in total</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/fake-google-reviews.jpg" alt="find fake google reviews" /></p>

<p>If you observe the total number of reviews made by fake reviewers, it is mostly there is only one or two. If you notice above mentioned points, and has less reviews, it is likely possible the review isn’t genuine.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Exaggerated and lengthy content
Some genuine reviewers like writing a review to detail. But you may find some fake reviews to be over exaggerated and longer than necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Private contribution profile</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can check the reviewer’s profile by tapping on the name, most fake reviewers if they have written multiple reviews chances are higher that they will keep their contribution profile private.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Company name/ staff’s name all CAPS
Do you write a review by capitalizing businesses’ name? Yeah, may be sometimes, but not really. But doesn’t it seem like the capitalized name is for highlighting, to seek attention? Guess who will use this the most, obviously the fakers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Staff’s name repeated  multiple times with a lot of praises (or blames if negative review)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Example</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“… ABC was very kind and professional. … ABC explained the process and cost. … ABC offered a discount… Thanks ABC and DEF company, you guys are awesome!”</p>
